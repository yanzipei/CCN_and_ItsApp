# RGB Color Model Aware Computational Color Naming and Its Application to Data Augmentation
## Requirements
Please refer to `requirments.txt` for details.

## Project Structure
The main directories of this project:
```text
.
├── App
│   └── DataAugmentation
└── CCN
```
where `./CCN` contains the code for computational color naming (CCN), `./App/DataAugmentation` contains the code for (image) data augmentation.

## Experiments on CCN
Please refer to `./CCN/README.md`

## Experiments on Image Classification
Please refer to `./App/DataAugmentation/README.md`
